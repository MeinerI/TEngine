# Odyssey Game Engine

The three main projects:
* TEngine - contains the main game engine
* TEngineBenchmarks - used to time the speed of components such as the memory allocators (basic at the moment)
* TEngineEditor - not started yet, will be the world editor
* TEngineTests - unit tests for the main engine

TEngine contains its own readme.
